# Hull-white

Hull-White model, a sophisticated framework in financial mathematics designed to price interest rate derivatives, such as zero-coupon bonds (ZCBs) and bond options, by modeling the dynamics of short-term interest rates. A key strength of term structure models like Hull-White is their ability to precisely replicate the market’s initial term structure, ensuring that ZCB prices align perfectly with observed market prices. This precision is remarkable given the model’s incorporation of stochastic interest rate fluctuations, prompting a critical question: how does it achieve such accuracy in the presence of randomness? 

Our suite of Python programs addresses this through five comprehensive components. First, we model the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to understand the stochastic evolution of interest rates, characterized by mean reversion and volatility. Second, we compute ZCB prices, leveraging market data to match observed prices. Third, we analyze the impact of varying the mean reversion speed ($   a   $) and volatility ($   \sigma   $) parameters, examining how the model’s deterministic and stochastic components adjust to maintain market alignment. Fourth, we extend the model to price bond options, such as European calls, to explore how randomness influences derivative valuations. Finally, we verify bond put-call parity, ensuring pricing consistency and arbitrage-free conditions. 

These programs collectively demonstrate how the Hull-White model balances stochastic uncertainty with deterministic calibration, a fundamental concept for financial professionals navigating interest rate markets. By exploring these components, you will gain a deep understanding of how mathematical rigor underpins accurate pricing in the face of economic uncertainty, laying the foundation for advanced applications in risk management and derivatives pricing.
